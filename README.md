## Description
Here is our team project for datatone. We preprocessed several datasets and create our own for further analysis. Different datasets contain information related to mortality, air pollution, smoking rate and happiness level.   

## Aim
To describe relationship between air pollution, smoking rate, happiness level of people and mortality rate caused by respiratory diseases.   

**Briefing**  
- Pipeline of data analysis you can find in the main notebook.  
- There are 8 datasets.
- We should preprocess row data and create dataset for analysis.
- We should perform EDA and prepare data for modeling.
- *We should perform prediction model with target parameter 'mortality'.  

**Skills**  
  
Train team building.    
Train time memanagement.   
Train row data preprocessing.  
Train analytics skills.   
Train data modeling.      

## Datasets
You can find all datasets in the main project folder.  
Original sourses of data:  
1. [Air pollution](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/aqdh-country-trends-major-air-pollutants-2003-2018)
